# Credit-card-fraud-detection-project
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Since fraudulent transactions are rare and labels are often not available in real-world scenarios, unsupervised learning provides a scalable and flexible solution for anomaly detection.
